These are some scripts I wrote to help me watch online videos on my terms.
Also, stream them.

Basically vidLink is in charge of taking in a page and grabbing the link to the video on that page.

The other scripts do different things with those links.
All of these scripts currently take input from the Mac clipboard. (Well, except playVids)

testVid: This just prints the link out, so I can debug / make sure it works
clipVid: This takes the link and plays it.
getVids: This is a loop. It puts each link into ~/.vids (For making a playlist with a bunch of links)
playVids: This plays each link that's in ~/.vids (For playing that playlist)

Right now it's very much dependent on my system.
I'm ok with that for now.
For example, it hard-codes a couple of paths, and it relies on my "scrape" util.

Also, I've included urlDecode in here.
It just calls php to urlDecode stdin to stdout.
